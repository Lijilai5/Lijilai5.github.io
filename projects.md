# Projects

Welcome to my list of projects! Hopefully I can convince you that I am interested in robotics. You'll find a selection of personal and interpersonal projects that prove (as adequately as they can) my skills in project development, robotics, machine learning, and more.

## Featured Projects

### 1. **Robotics Arm Controller**
- **Description:** Developed a Python-based inverse kinematics and control system for a PUMA robotic arm, capable of precise object manipulation.
- **Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Robotics Toolbox
- **Repository:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/yourusername/robotics-arm-controller)

### 2. **Polymer Foam Analysis with Deep Learning**
- **Description:** Built a deep learning pipeline to analyze SEM images of polymer foams for cellular size distribution. Improved speed and accuracy of feature extraction.
- **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, OpenCV
- **Repository:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/yourusername/polymer-foam-analysis)

### 3. **Discrete Histogram Equalization**
- **Description:** Implemented an 8-bit grayscale image histogram equalization algorithm including histogram, PDF, CDF, and normalized mapping.
- **Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Repository:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/yourusername/histogram-equalization)

### 4. **RL Pong Agent**
- **Description:** Created a reinforcement learning agent to play Atari Pong using the Arcade Learning Environment.
- **Technologies:** Python, Gym, PyTorch
- **Repository:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/yourusername/rl-pong-agent)
